Integrated the Google Maps API into a React web app with a PostgreSQL database, using the Foundation front end along with custom CSS.

## ðŸŒ± Install

Prerequisites
Install <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup">Git</a> if you don't already have it.

Install yarn via npm

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

Install <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/download/" >PostGreSQL</a>

Use Git to clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gkimbo/within-reach.git
```

```bash
cd within-reach
yarn install
```

Create database with

```bash
createdb within-reach_development
```

Run migration with

```bash
yarn run migrate:latest
```

Launch the app

```bash
yarn run dev
```

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project:

```dosini
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
```

You will also need the google maps api key as well as the keys in .env.example file.

As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:

```javascript
require("dotenv").config();
console.log(process.env); // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
```

.. [or using ES6?](#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import)

```javascript
import "dotenv/config";
```

That's it. `process.env` now has the keys and values you defined in your `.env` file:

Then, navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser and make sure you're getting the page!
