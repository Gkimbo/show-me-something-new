WithinReach is a location-based platform that instantly provides personalized recommendations for tailored places, events, and experiences; Eliminating the need for extensive searching. The Google Maps API has been integrated into a React web app with a PostgreSQL database. API requests are made from the React frontend to the Express backend using the 'fetch' method, and third-party API requests are handled using the 'got' library on the backend.
